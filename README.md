# MIT Pacmen Exercise

## What is it?

---

This is one of the exercises of the MITxPro-MERN course, on the "Styles and Bootstap" module.

This exercise generates a PacMan by clicking on the button "Add PacMan". By clicking on the button "Start Game", the PacMen will start moving randomly all over the screen bouncing on the edges. 

## Installaion

To run this code, simply fork and clone this repo, and run the index.html file using a server (everything the repo needs to run is in the files that you will be downloading when cloning the repo).

## Roadmap
